The goal is to simulate a real working coffee shop website — something you could genuinely expand in the future when you open your own café

The project serves as both a practical business prototype and a personal creative vision, designed to demonstrate technical proficiency, user experience design, and entrepreneurial thinking. This project also provides a modern, functional web platform that represents what a real café could use  with branding, a menu, and customer interaction tools. It helps local cafés expand their reach, build trust, and compete digitally. 

BrewHaven Café PH bridges the gap between traditional café culture and digital innovation... solving real-world challenges in efficiency, engagement, and management.
